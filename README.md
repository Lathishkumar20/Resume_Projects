 # PROBLEM STATEMENT
 In the vibrant city of Bangalore, the restaurant industry is thriving, offering diverse dining experiences. However, selecting the right location for a 
 restaurant is a complex decision that significantly impacts its success. In this project, we address the challenge of identifying the most favorable restaurant 
 locations in Bangalore.

 # METHODOLOGY
 Data Collection: We gather restaurant data from various sources, including online review platforms, restaurant booking systems, and public datasets.

 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Raw data is cleaned, formatted, and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involves handling missing values, 
 removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We perform EDA to analyze and visualize the restaurant data. This includes identifying trends, patterns, and correlations to 
 gain insights into customer preferences, popular cuisines, and dining trends.

 Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning algorithms, we build predictive models to forecast customer demand, predict peak dining hours, and recommend 
 personalized dining experiences.

 Data Visualization: We create interactive visualizations and dashboards to communicate insights effectively. This enables stakeholders to make data-driven 
 decisions and take actionable steps to improve restaurant performance.
